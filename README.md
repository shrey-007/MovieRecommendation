In a folder named PythonAPI , I have created our flask API, which takes movie as a input and recommends similar movies

### Spring Boot
Through springboot controller we are calling that flask api, but to call spring boot controller you have to paste this in browser/postman 
http://localhost:8080/movies/recommend?movie=Avatar
